## Your responsibilities

1. Read the immutable Python API contract at `{contract_path}`.
2. Read the trusted Generate preflight evidence at
   `{source_dir / "generation_preflight.json"}`.
3. Inspect the staged correctness harness at `{harness_path}`, the build
   scaffold, `profile_pmc.sh`, hardware, and complete shape list below.
4. Confirm that the repository contains no HIP implementation.
5. Review or preserve the GPU assignment as instructed below.
6. Write only `{source_dir / "proposal.json"}`.

## Hard role boundary

You are not a kernel implementation agent. Do not write, edit, rename, or
delete any HIP, C++, CUDA, Python backend, setup/build, test, benchmark, or
public API file. In particular, do not create `.hip`, `.cu`, `.cpp`,
`w8a8_backend.py`, or `setup.py`. Do not compile or run the correctness
harness. The control plane has staged only the immutable API and build/loader
scaffolding. After assignment, child implementation Agents create their
initial HIP kernels from scratch during Parallel explore, and the control
plane validates them.

The API contract is user-owned and immutable. The repository scaffold and
interface have already been prepared by the control plane.
The fixed public call is `w8a8_gemm_out(...)`; its backend operation is
`torch.ops.zth_w8a8.gemm_out`.
The trusted scaffold contains `w8a8_bench.py` and `profile_pmc.sh`. Do not
modify or execute them. The control plane has already run the harness's CPU
PyTorch-reference self-test, probed GPU visibility, checked PMC script syntax,
verified the real hipprof command, and recorded those facts in
`generation_preflight.json`. Actual kernel correctness and PMC collection are
deferred until a child Agent creates a kernel during Parallel explore.

## GPU assignment policy

## Task context

- Operator: {operator}
- Dtype: {dtype}
- Hardware: {hardware}
- Kernel language for child agents: {kernel_language}
- Child workers: between 1 and 4 non-empty workers
- Mapping: worker_N→physical GPU N; one to four non-empty workers
- Assignment instruction: {assignment_rule}

| ID | M | N | K |
|---|---|---|---|
{_shapes_table(shapes)}

The assignment unit is one exact shape ID. Different M variants of the same
logical operator may be assigned to different workers; for example,
`m4_wqkv_a` and `m16_wqkv_a` may use different shape-specific HIP kernels.
The fixed public API remains one interface, and final synthesis dispatches to
the selected kernel by shape. Every target shape must appear exactly once.

implementation has been supplied. Create the initial HIP kernel for the
assigned shapes from scratch. Only the staged optional variant file may be
adapted as a reference under the rules below; do not copy another task repo.

## Immutable interface

Read `{api_contract_path}` and preserve it byte-for-byte. Implement its private
backend contract without creating a second public API.

## Required implementation

The control plane owns these staged scaffold files under `{source_dir}`:

- `w8a8_backend.py`
- `w8a8_graph.py`
- `setup.py`
- `csrc/bindings.cpp`

You own and must create `csrc/w8a8_gemm_hip.hip`. Do not assume an existing
compiled kernel is present.

The trusted binding already registers both `gemm_out` and the optional
out-of-timed-region `pack_weight` operation. Your HIP file must provide these
two stable host launch symbols:

- `launch_w8a8_gemm(..., void* workspace, int64_t workspace_bytes,
  int m, int n, int k, hipStream_t stream)`;
- `launch_pack_w8a8_weight(raw_weight, weight_scale, packed_weight,
  packed_weight_scale, int k, int n, hipStream_t stream)`.

Bootstrap `launch_pack_w8a8_weight` as an identity device-to-device copy.
Later Parallel explore rounds may change only its HIP implementation and the
matching GEMM interpretation to test packed layouts. The main coordinator and
Generate phase never write the HIP implementation.

Register `torch.ops.zth_w8a8.gemm_out`, return the exact caller-provided `out`
tensor, use PyTorch's current HIP stream, and preserve graph-safe behavior.
The trusted harness rejects the bootstrap unless this fixed Python API can be
captured on a non-default stream with `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph`, replayed for
exact correctness, and called from Python through `w8a8_graph.py`.
The mathematical reference is:
`(A.float() @ B.float()) * x_scale * weight_scale.T`, converted to bfloat16.

The timed operator must perform no allocation, compilation, autotuning,
weight packing, host synchronization, device synchronization, or default-
stream launch. It may use only the caller-provided `out` and `workspace`.
Weight packing, if implemented, belongs in the optional `pack_weight` op
outside the timed region.

`w8a8_backend.py` must keep the control-plane entry point
`load_extension()`. It uses `torch.utils.cpp_extension.load(...,
is_python_module=False)` because the operator is registered through
`TORCH_LIBRARY`. Never replace it with an import of a prebuilt `.so` or an
installed package.

without switching type families.

For every path:

1. Include the installed headers in this known-good order:
   `<hip/hip_runtime.h>`, then `<hip/hip_bfloat16.h>`, then `<du_mma.h>`.
   This DTK's `du_mma.h` is not self-contained when included before the HIP
   runtime headers. Do not include or invent `du_mma_common.h`; it is not an
   installed public header.
2. Keep adjacent lanes on adjacent addresses in the fastest-changing N
   dimension. Audit every hard-coded warp value: gfx928 wavefront is 64, not
   32; blockDim must be a multiple of 64.
3. Accumulate the integer dot product in int32. The maximum assigned K keeps
   the exact int8 dot within int32 range. Convert to float only for
   `dot * x_scale[m] * packed_weight_scale[n]`, then store bf16.
4. Use `hipLaunchKernelGGL` on PyTorch's current HIP stream. Never use
   stream 0, `hipDeviceSynchronize`, `hipStreamSynchronize`, or a temporary
   allocation in `gemm_out`.
5. Never use NVIDIA `wmma`, `mma.sync`, PTX, warp=32 masks, FP8, or INT4 on
   gfx928.
6. Keep all barriers on paths reached by every thread in the block. Budget
   LDS before choosing single/double buffering; bootstrap should prefer one
   correct, understandable buffer over speculative complexity.
7. Support every assigned shape through explicit dispatch where launch
   geometry differs. Do not specialize for only the first shape.
8. Keep a scalar generic fallback for every unmatched `(m,n,k)`. Later
   optimization rounds will specialize only an exact shape and the accepted
   object will be linked directly into the final extension. In particular,
   an M=16 specialization must remain guarded so the paired M=2 API shape
   with the same `(N,K)` still reaches the scalar fallback correctly. Keep
   `launch_pack_w8a8_weight` valid for unmatched `(K,N)` as well; identity
   device-to-device packing is its generic fallback.

## Execution boundary

Do not run the benchmark or correctness harness. Do not invoke Docker, SSH,
Skill tools, pip, apt, conda, network access, package installation,
environment activation, filesystem-wide searches such as `find /`, or
PyTorch/CUDA environment probes. Read only the immutable API, named scaffold
files, and optional `references/w8a8_gemm_variants.hip`. The trusted control plane already owns the correct
DTK/PyTorch environment and will compile, run exact correctness, and measure
median/P90 after you return. Your job is source implementation only.

You may inspect the immutable API and scaffold source read-only. Preserve
`w8a8_backend.py`, `setup.py`, and `csrc/bindings.cpp`. You may change only
`csrc/w8a8_gemm_hip.hip` plus `proposal.json`. Do not edit tests, the harness,
cache/build artifacts, or files outside this worktree.

Then write `{source_dir / "proposal.json"}` as strict JSON:
